In an Einstein-de Sitter Universe where the only component in the equations of state is matter with density $\Omega_m$=1, the scale factor can be found via the Friedmann Equation as

\begin{equation}
  a(t) = \left(\frac{3}{2}H_0t\right)^{2/3}
\end{equation}

Separating the temporal and spatial components in the Second O.D.E. of density perturbations: $
